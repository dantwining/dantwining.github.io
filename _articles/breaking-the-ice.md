Back in the beginnings of my career, when I was starting to run more and more meetings, I read two articles that have really shaped the way
that I approach opening a meeting, especially if it's a workshop or some other collaborative session.

The first article was [What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.htm).
It's a relatively lengthy read that covers a lot of ground, but at its essence it promotes psychologically safety as the
bedrock of good teamwork, and the biggest takeaway (for me, as a meeting facilitiator) is the conclusion that [on \[...\] good teams, members \[speak\] in roughly the same proportion, a phenomenon \[...\] referred to as "equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking."](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html#:~:text=on%20the%20good%20teams%2C%20members%20spoke%20in%20roughly%20the%20same%20proportion%2C%20a%20phenomenon%20the%20researchers%20referred%20to%20as%20%E2%80%98%E2%80%98equality%20in%20distribution%20of%20conversational%20turn%2Dtaking.%E2%80%99%E2%80%99). When good teams have a meeting, [all the team members speak as much as they need to.](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html#:~:text=all%20the%20team%20members%20speak%20as%20much%20as%20they%20need%20to.)

Since then, I've always summarised this in my head as **everyone has a say, and everyone says what they think**. But how to get the team to share out the conversation?

The second article, which unfortunately is lost in the mists of time, was all about this challenge. Specifically, it talked about the strong correlation between getting people off mute at the start of a meeting (for any reason at all, no matter how trivial) and their willingness to speak in the meeting proper.
