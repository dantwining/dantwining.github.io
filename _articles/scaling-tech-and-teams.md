### Discover and Define your System Boundaries

#### Domain-Driven Design 
- Martin Fowler's bliki has an introductory article covering [Domain-Driven Design](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/DomainDrivenDesign.html).
- Eric Evans's book [Domain-Driven Design](https://www.hive.co.uk/Product/Eric-Evans/Domain-Driven-Design--Tackling-Complexity-in-the-Heart-of-Software/753867) is considered to be the definitive reference.
- Vaughn Vernon's book [Implementing Domain-Driven Design](https://www.hive.co.uk/Product/Vaughn-Vernon/Implementing-Domain-Driven-Design/14027537) provides an alternative, and possibly more accessible, guide (and is also available [second hand](https://www.wob.com/en-gb/books/vaughn-vernon/implementing-domain-driven-design/9780321834577)).

#### Event Storming
- LinkedIn Learning's course on Domain-Driven Design includes a useful [introduction to Event Storming](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/software-architecture-domain-driven-design/what-is-event-storming).
- Alberto Brandolini, the inventor of Event Storming, has written [Introducing Event Storming](https://leanpub.com/introducing_eventstorming) which is often recommended as the definitive guide.

### Build Tech to your Boundaries
Many of the reference materials required for building your tech to your boundaries will be specific to your situation.
- For many, a microservices architecture will be appropriate. In such situations, [Building Microservices by Sam Newman](https://www.hive.co.uk/Product/Sam-Newman/Building-Microservices--Designing-Fine-Grained-Systems/21984552) is highly recommended (also available [second hand](https://www.wob.com/en-gb/books/sam-newman/building-microservices/9781492034025), as is [the first edition](https://www.wob.com/en-gb/books/sam-newman/building-microservices/9781491950357), which seems to be so cheap it's practically being given away).

### Align Teams to your Tech
- [Team Topologies](https://www.hive.co.uk/Product/Matthew-Skelton/Team-Topologies--Organizing-Business-and-Technology-Teams-for-Fast-Flow/24144147) is the go-to book for team alignment in software delivery. There is also a [Key Concepts](https://teamtopologies.com/key-concepts) cheat sheet for anyone looking for a TLDR (although I would highly recommend reading the whole book).
- In addition, the Inverse Conway Manoeuvre is described as part of an article on Martin Fowler's bliki on [Conway's Law](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ConwaysLaw.html).
